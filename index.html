    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <br><br>
    <div id="about">
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>My name is Madeline and I am a 2nd year student at Western Washington University.
      I am working towards a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, with a minor in Communication Studies.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>I am also an undergraduate research assistant in Dr. Caroline Hardin's lab! Our current projects focus on CS Education,
        Hackathons, and Digital Privacy. I am currently working with a few of my other lab members on developing the website, which
        you can find <a href="indexinbounds.org" target="_blank">here</a>!
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>When I'm not programming, I like to listen to music, go grocery shopping (weird hobby, I know, but weirdly therapeutic), 
        and watch television.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>Below I have linked a couple projects in my GitHub repository. <strong>NOTE:</strong>I have more notable, extensive 
        projects in a private repository. If you are interested in viewing them, please <a href="#contact">contact me</a> and I 
        will add you as a collaborator!

            <dd>This is a small project I worked on to practice implementing an adjacency matrix and breadth-first search. 
            My main method accepts an argument for a text file whose first line specifies the number of nodes |V| and 
            whose suceeding lines contain two integers indicating an edge between the two nodes. Nodes in the graph are 
            numbered sequentially from 0..|V| and when run, the program will print the number of connected components in the graph.

            <dd>
              This was the final assignment for my CSCI 141 - Intro to Programming class (Winter 2020). The goal was to implement 
              a Machine Learning framework using Python to develop a rule-based classifier that predicts if an unknown 
              tumor is malignant or benign.
